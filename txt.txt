              I support that emphasis with research in algorithmic game theory and
              multi-agent reinforcment learning under prof. <Link href="https://panageas.github.io/" underline="hover">Ioannis Panageas</Link>.

              Broadly, my research interests lie in games and deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning. As is observable by my projects,
              I have a passion for football/soccer and the associated video game FIFA. Recently, I have taken an interest in robustness, 
              meta-learning, and unsupervised environment design.

              In my free time I play water polo, lift weights, and play the bass, alto saxophone, and ukelele.
