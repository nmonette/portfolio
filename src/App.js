              I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of California Irvine, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
              <br/><br/>
              I specialize in Intelligent Systems, which is UCI's AI/ML emphasis. I support that emphasis with research in Algorithmic Game Theory and
              Multi-Agent Reinforcment Learning under Dr. Ioannis Panageas.
              <br/><br/>
              Broadly, my research interests lie in games and deep learning, particularly deep reinforcement learning. As is observable by my projects,
              I have a passion for European football/soccer and the associated video game FIFA. I am also interested in various aspects of Full-Stack software development.
              <br/><br/>
              In my free time I play water polo, lift weights, and play the bass, alto saxophone, and ukelele.

          ZotScheduler uses tree-ensemble regression models 
          and search algorithms to find the optimal schedule for a UCI student given a set of potential classes for the upcoming quarter.
          <br/><br/>
         I led the AI part of our project, culminating in a "Best AI Hack" award, as well as overall runner-up out of 60+ teams at HackUCI.

          FIFARank is a learning project using scraped popularity and player data from FIFA websites. By utilizing tree and deep learning methods 
          I was able to rank players in the most recent FIFA video game (FIFA 23) in terms of their competitive desirability.

          FootballSim is a simple European Football simulator that I made for a future project exploring the reward tradeoffs surrounding the offside trap in Football.

          FIFADraft is a fantasy soccer draft app that I made for FIFA tournaments that assists with the creation of custom teams not already 
          preset by the game. I incorporated database structuring that allows users in the same lobby to draft synchronously.
